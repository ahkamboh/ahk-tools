# AI Tools

## 1) Resume Builder AI Powered
## 2) Recommendation Letter Generator

This repository contains two powerful AI tools built with Ruby on Rails, Tailwind CSS, and the Gemini API. Both tools utilize PostgreSQL for the backend database and Stimulus JS for JavaScript functionalities.

### Project Overview

- **Resume Builder AI Powered:** This tool helps users create professional resumes with ease. By leveraging the Gemini API, the tool offers intelligent suggestions and formatting options to ensure resumes are polished and impactful.

- **Recommendation Letter Generator:** This tool simplifies the process of creating recommendation letters. Using AI capabilities, it generates personalized and well-structured recommendation letters based on user inputs and preferences.

### Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails:** A robust framework used for building the backend of the tools.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for designing responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.
- **Gemini API:** An advanced API integrated to provide AI-powered functionalities.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database used for managing backend data.
- **Stimulus JS:** A modest JavaScript framework used for adding interactivity to the application.
